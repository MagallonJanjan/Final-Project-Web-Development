                    suitable applicant for a posted job listing,
                    job applicants must make available their relevant personal data to potential employers. Since the

                    postings ("Job Postings") offered are in compliance with the applicable labor laws in the
                    Philippines. You further agree you can only
                    use any applicant's data for the limited purpose of evaluating the applican for possible engagement,
                    and you agree to delete any unneeded applicant data promptly and be held liable for any unlawful
                    distribution of such data without
